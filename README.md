- Rendering a list of transactions with dummy data.

Please note that this project is a UI demonstration and does not include any actual functionalities.

## Live Coding Session

This project was coded live on "The Flutter Guys" [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@flutterguys). The live coding session was an interactive way to demonstrate the power and simplicity of Flutter. Viewers got to see the development process in real-time, including how to structure the project, define models, create widgets, and more.

## Testing

While the live coding session was focused on building the UI, we believe in the importance of testing in software development. Therefore, we have added several unit tests to the project after the session. These tests ensure the correctness of the code and provide examples of how to write tests for Flutter apps. However, these tests were not part of the live coding session.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project:

1. Use `git clone https://github.com/monster555/flutter_guys_banking_app` in your terminal.
2. Use `cd <project-name>` to navigate into the root directory of the project. Replace `<project-name>` with the name of the project.
3. Run `flutter pub get` to download all the necessary Dart and Flutter packages your project depends on.
4. Run f`lutter run` to start the Flutter development server and open the app in debug mode in your default browser or connected device. If you have multiple devices connected, use `flutter run -d <device-id>` to specify the device to run the app on.
5. 
Remember to have Flutter installed and set up correctly before running these commands. If you encounter any issues, refer to the [Flutter documentation](https://docs.flutter.dev/) for help.
